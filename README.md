YoloCommerce
=======

The only ecommerce platform powered by bad ideas the developers will likely regret tomorrow. But, like you and everyone else, we only live once so YoloCommerce.

## Installation

You don't really want to install, do you? Okay if you do I suggest installing it in production over ftp. Not sftp. ftp. That's really the best way.

Note: This is not intended to be production software. Only deploy this in production is your life philosophy is really #YOLO.

## Tests

Tests are written using a very special invisible version of [PHPUnit](https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit). You may or may not be able to run them.

## License

This software is licensed under the [MIT License](LICENSE) only because I was not able to find a license that conveyed the lack of seriousness in this code.

## Contributing

All contributions will be mocked mercilessly. I'm not sure you want to go there. But on the off change you do, please make sure what you contribute has lots of bugs. After all, bugs are merely undocumented features right up until someone documents them in an issue report. Then they are full-fledged features.
